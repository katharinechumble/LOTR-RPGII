# LOTR-RPG

## User Story
A quaint little trip through Middle Earth, with an adventure or two on the way. You can be an elf, a hobbit, a wizard, etc. On your journey, you’ll be given paths from which to choose. May you choose wisely. 
A classic text-based rpg 
As serious Tolkien fans, our group was drawn to this project much like Bilbo is drawn to the one ring.
As the user, you’ll first choose your character type (hobbit, dwarf, etc.) and your character’s name. Over the course of play, you’ll be presented with challenging scenarios that are faithful to the canon. For each scenario, you’ll be presented with two choices, one of which is the wise choice, while the other does you harm. If you choose unwisely, one point is deducted from your character’s health, which starts at twenty. Remember, the fate of Middle Earth rests in your hands.
